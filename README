This is my repository for the Croissant Sound Widget app on Google Play.

This little trivial project started as a simple stupid thing with one of my friends to create an Android widget that was supposed 
to play the "croissant" sound on tap. Eventually it became a nice way for me to delve into the Android widgets APIs that I've never 
worked with, plus a few more interesting bits I've picked up along the way, so I guess all in all it's not that useless. But still 
useless :)
